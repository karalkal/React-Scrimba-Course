#  A collection of a few basic web apps built with React JS 

#### Scrimba

The content of this folder is based on Scrimba's excellent free React JS online course which can be found here:
https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact

My code differs from the one provided by the tutor (Bob Ziroll), because I found it more valuable to try to implement the functionalities more independently while of course following closely their approach and solutions.
It goes without saying that the latter is far better than my own creations.


#### Contents

01. Files with names tarting with 01.* to 09.* are from the Basic course, which [could be found here ](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).
The tenizes project has a refactored version where the old style React.createElement() has been used instead of JSX. 
The app in 09-solo--quizzical is a solo project and differs significantly from the original design and idea - in my humble opinion for the better. 
02. Files in 10-class-components folder are from [Learn Class Components in React](https://scrimba.com/learn/classcomponents/)
03. Files with names starting with x-* are short snippets of code representing some of the main concepts covered.
